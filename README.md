# Assignment-Two

Most important file are the Assignment-Two.html provided. 
The Assignment-Two.rmd is the raw code used to render the html. 
Clark_paper_data.csv contains the data for the Clark paper that was then utilised in the Assignment-Two.rmd - as was ocean_meta_data.csv and meta-data_ocean_meta.csv 

Workflow: my workflow was based on doing the assignment questions in order - alot of trial and error was present in order to find the correct solution for certain figures. By working sequentially through the questions, it allowed to build understanding of the answers as I went on. Referring to literature in perusal and utilising the tutorials was the wisest way to first approach questions, and then searching the internet for solutions to error messages.
